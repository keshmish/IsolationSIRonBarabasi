# IsolationSIRonBarabasi
Code for the paper "Quality Criteria for Control of epidemics" by Vikenty Mikheev, 2020. Barabasi temporal graph with SIR model is used to find the optimal delay for an isolation to control the epidemic in a view of two quality criteria: total number of infected and maximum number of infected. The simulations are run on 5,000 and 10,000 nodes for 180-300 days.
